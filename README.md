# Note-Taker

The Note-Taker application is designed primarily for small buisness owners or other busy individuals who struggle keeping track of their daily to-do's

I worked exclusively on the back end on this project using primarily express.js to create routes that would allow note creation, retreival and navigation to the various pages by linking the established front-end together with the back-end
